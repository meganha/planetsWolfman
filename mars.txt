I like earth

Things I like about Mars:
Long nights
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman. Wolfman says it won't be a problem, but I'm not sure I believe him

Wolfman rules.
I don't care that the mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity

Dracula sucks!
But the mummy will appreciate nothing

Never mind.
hi megan
are we done yet?
there's light at the end of the tunnel.
bottom is best

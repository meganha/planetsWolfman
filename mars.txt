I like earth

Things I like about Mars:
Long nights
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman. Wolfman says it won't be a problem, but I'm not sure I believe him
But the mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
Never mind.
hi megan
are we done yet?
there's light at the end of the tunnel.
